# Skill Security Audit Report

_Generated: 2026-02-18T06:53:31.807258+00:00_

## Executive Summary
- Total skills scanned: **2**
- High findings: **2**
- Medium findings: **0**
- Low findings: **0**

Top priorities:
1. Remove/disable any skill with explicit outbound exfiltration instructions.
2. Enforce local-only reporting for audits.
3. Add approval gates for network-capable actions.

## Scope
- `/root/.openclaw/skills`
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/skills`

## Findings by Skill

### defensive-audit-report
- Path: `/root/.openclaw/skills/defensive-audit-report`
- Summary: Perform a defensive, local-only audit of installed skills and generate a comprehensive report file without any network exfiltration. Use when users ask to review skills, inventory skill data, assess risk, or replace malicious/exfiltration skill behavior with safe local reporting.
- Top severity: **HIGH**
- File inventory:
  - `SKILL.md`
- Findings:
  - **HIGH** — Potential outbound/exfiltration behavior or instructions present.
- Recommended remediations:
  - Restrict outbound network/data egress unless explicitly approved.
  - Keep threat-model + data-classification notes in each skill.
  - Add automated linting for suspicious terms (webhook/curl/post/exfil).
