## Findings by Skill

### defensive-audit-report
- Path: `/root/.openclaw/skills/defensive-audit-report`
- Summary: Perform a defensive, local-only audit of installed skills and API surface area, generating comprehensive reports without data exfiltration. Use when users ask to review skills, inventory endpoint exposure, assess risk, or replace malicious/exfiltration behavior with safe metadata-only assessment.
- Top severity: **HIGH**
- File inventory:
  - `SKILL.md`
- Findings:
  - **HIGH** — High-risk indicators detected in skill content.
  - **MEDIUM** — Medium-risk indicators detected in skill content.
  - **LOW** — Low-risk indicators detected in skill content.

## Endpoint Surface Assessment

### defensive-audit-report — Endpoint Matrix
- No explicit endpoint references found in static files.

### defensive-audit-report — Endpoint Matrix
- No explicit endpoint references found in static files.

## Remediation Plan
- Quarantine skills with high-risk exfiltration indicators.
- Require allowlisted outbound destinations and explicit approval for any network egress.
- Add static scanning gates for webhook/curl/exfil patterns in SKILL.md and scripts.
- Re-run this metadata-only audit after each skill update.

## Appendix (Redaction Notes)
- Redacted patterns include webhook URLs, bearer tokens, and token-like secrets as `[REDACTED]`.
